                                    I was born February 20, 2000 in Sacramento.
                                    I have lived there for the majority of my life and intend on moving back. 
                                    I grew up with 2 loving parents and two amazing sisters. My life is centered around 4 things.

                                        My faith has always been very important to me. I grew up a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints and I have come to 
                                        have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as I have gone to church and lived the teachings of the gospel. 
                                        When I was 19 I decided to serve a 2 year mission. I was assigned to Vina Del Mar Chile, and later reassigned to Nebraska due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                                        I loved my mission. I made so many friends and strengthend my personal relationship with Jesus Christ in ways I never thought I could.

                                        Some of my favorite memories growing up have been going on trips with my family. My favorite trip that we have been on recently was our trip to hawaii.
                                        We had a great time going on fun adventures and just hanging out by the pool or on the beach.

                                       I have always loved playing and watching sports. Some of my best memories growing up came from watching a game with my dad, or playing in an event. 
                                       Football has always been the sport I've loved most. I played for 11 years and enjoyed every second of it. I trained and worked so I could be the best player I could be.
                                       The hard work payed off. I currently hold 3 school records and had the opportunity to play in college as well.
